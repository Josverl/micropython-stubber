# 5 - CPython and Frozen modules 

## 5.1 - Frozen Modules 

It is common for Firmwares to include a few (or many) python modules as 'frozen' modules. 
'Freezing' modules is a way to pre-process .py modules so they're 'baked-in' to MicroPython' s firmware and use less memory. Once the code is frozen it can be quickly loaded and interpreted by MicroPython without as much memory and processing time.

Most OSS firmwares store these frozen modules as part of their repository, which allows us to: 

1. Download the *.py from the (github) repo using `git clone` or a direct download 

2. Extract and store the 'unfrozen' modules (ie the *.py files) in a <Firmware>_Frozen folder.
   if there are different port / boards or releases defined , there may be multiple folders such as: 

   * stubs/micropython_1_12_frozen

     * /esp32

       * /GENERIC
       * /RELEASE
       * /TINYPICO

     * /stm32

       * /GENERIC
       * /PYBD_SF2

       

3. generate typeshed stubs of these files. (the .pyi files will be stored alongside the .py files)

4. Include/use them in the configuration

## 5.2 - Collect Frozen Stubs (micropython) 

This is run daily though the github action workflow : get-all-frozen in the micropython-stubs repo.

If you want to run this manually 
- Check out repos side-by-side:
    - micropython-stubs
    - micropython-stubber
    - micropython
    - micropython-lib

- link repos using all_stubs symlink
- checkout tag / version in the micropython folder  
  (for most accurate results should checkout micropython-lib for the same date)
- run `src/get-frozen.py`
- run `src/update-stubs.py`

- create a PR for changes to the stubs repo 

## 5.3 - Postprocessing 

You can run postprocessing for all stubs by running either of the two scripts.
There is an optional parameter to specify the location of the stub folder. The default path is `./all_stubs`

Powershell:  
``` powershell
./scripts/updates_stubs.ps1 [-path ./mystubs]

```
or python  
``` bash
python ./src/update_stubs.py [./mystubs]
```

This will generate or update the `.pyi` stubs for all new (and existing) stubs in the `./all_stubs` or specified folder.

From version '1.3.8' the  `.pyi` stubs are generated using `stubgen`, before that the `make_stub_files.py` script was used.

Stubgen is run on each 'collected stub folder' (that contains a `modules.json` manifest) using the options : `--ignore-errors --include-private` and the resulting `.pyi` files are stored in the same folder (`foo.py` and `foo.pyi` are stored next to each other).

In some cases `stubgen` detects duplicate modules in a 'collected stub folder', and subsequently does not generate any stubs for any `.py` module or script.
then __Plan B__ is to run stubgen for each separate `*.py` file in that folder. THis is significantly slower and according to the stubgen documentation the resulting stubs may of lesser quality, but that is better than no stubs at all.

**Note**: In several cases `stubgen` creates folders in inappropriate locations (reason undetermined), which would cause issues when re-running `stubgen` at a later time.
to compensate for this behaviour the known-incorrect .pyi files are removed before and after stubgen is run [see: `cleanup(modules_folder)` in `utils.py`](src\utils.py)

# 6 - Repo structure 

- [This and sister repos](#this-and-sister-repos) 
- [Structure of this repo](#structure-of-this-repo)
- [Naming Convention and Stub folder structure][naming-convention]
- 2 python versions 


## 6.1 - This and sister repos
| What                 | Why                      | Where                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| stubber project      | needed to make stubs     | develop/micropython-stubber|
| stubs sister repo    | stores collected stubs   | develop/micropython-stubs|
| micropython          | to collect frozen modules| develop/micropython|
| micropython-lib      | to collect frozen modules| develop/micropython-lib|


## 6.2 - Structure of this repo 

The file structure is based on my personal windows environment, but you should be able to adapt that without much hardship to you own preference and OS.

| What                 | Details                      | Where                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| stub root            | symlink to connect the 2 sister-repos | all_stubs|
| firmware stubber     | MicroPython              | board/createstubs.py|
| minified firmware stubber | MicroPython         | minified/createstubs.py|
| PC based scripts     | CPython                  | src/*|
| PC based scripts     | CPython                  | process.py|
| pytest tests         |                          | test/*|
|                           |                                       |                         |

## 6.3 - Naming Convention and Stub folder structure

| What                 | Why                      | Where                             |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| stub root            | connect the 2 repos                         | all_stubs|
| cpython stubs for micropython core | adapt for differences between CPython and MicroPython | stubs/cpython-core |
| generated stub files | needed to use stubs      | stubs/{firmware}-{port}-{version}-frozen |
| Frozen stub files    | better code intellisense | stubs/{firmware}-{version}-frozen |


Note: I found that, for me, using submodules caused more problems than it solved. So instead I link the two main repo's using a [symlink][].

***Note:*** I in the repo tests I have used the folders `TESTREPO-micropython`  and `TESTREPO-micropython-lib` to avoid conflicts with any development that you might be doing on similar `micropython` repos at the potential cost of a little disk space.

``` powershell
cd /develop 

git clone  https://github.com/josverl/micropython-stubber.git 
git clone  https://github.com/josverl/micropython-stubs.git 
git clone  https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git 
git clone  https://github.com/micropython/micropython.git 
```


## 6.4 - Create a symbolic link

To create the symbolic link to the `../micropython-stubs/stubs` folder the instructions differ slightly for each OS/
The below examples assume that the micropython-stubs repo is cloned 'next-to' your project folder.
please adjust as needed.

### 6.4.1 - Windows 10 

Requires `Developer enabled` or elevated powershell prompt.

``` powershell
# target must be an absolute path, resolve path is used to resolve the relative path to absolute
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "all-stubs" -Target (Resolve-Path -Path ../micropython-stubs/stubs)
```

or use [mklink](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mklink) in an (elevated) command prompt

``` sh
rem target must be an absolute path
mklink /d all-stubs c:\develop\micropython-stubs\stubs
```

### 6.4.2 - Linux/Unix/Mac OS

``` sh
# target must be an absolute path
ln -s /path/to/micropython-stubs/stubs all-stubs
```

------------

# 7 - Developing
I use Windows 10  and use WSL2 to run the linux based parts. 
if you develop on other platform, it is quite likely that you may need to change some details. if that is needed , please update/add to the documentation and send a documentation PR.

* clone 
* create python virtual environment (optional) 
* install requirements-dev 
* setup sister repos
* run test to verify setup 

## 7.1 - Wrestling with two pythons 

This project combines CPython and MicroPython in one project.  As a result you may/will need to switch the configuration of pylint and VSCode to match the section of code that you are working on.  This is caused by the fact that pylint does not support per-folder configuration 

to help switching there are 2 different .pylintrc files stored in the root of the project to simplify switching.

Similar changes will need to be done to the .vscode/settings.json 

If / when we can get pylance  to work with the micropython stubs , this may become simpler as 
Pylance natively supports [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces), meaning that you can open multiple folders in the same Visual Studio Code session and have Pylance functionality in each folder.

## 7.2 Minification 

if you make changes to the createstubs.py script , you should also update the minified version by running `python process.py minify` at some point.

if you forget to do this there is a github action that should do this for you and create a PR for your branch.

## 7.3 Testing 

MicroPython-Stubber has a number of tests written in Pytest

see below overview

| folder        | what                                               | how                                                          | used where              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| board         | createstubs.py<br />normal & minified              | runs createstubs.py on micropython-linux ports               | WSL2 and github actions |
| checkout_repo | simple_git module<br />retrieval of frozen modules | does not use mocking but actually retrieves different firmware versions locally using git or dowNloads modules for online | local windows           |
| common        | all other tests                                    | common                                                       | local + github action   |

also see [test documentation](tests/readme.md)

**Platform detection to support pytest**
In order to allow both simple usability om MicroPython and testability on Full Python,
createstubs does a runtime test to determine the actual platform it is running on while importing the module
This is similar to using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` preamble 
If running on MicroPython,
    then it starts stubbing 

``` python
if isMicroPython():
    main()
```
**Testing on micropython linux port(s)**
in order to be able to test `createstubs.py`, it has been updated to run on linux, and accept a --path parameter to indicate the path where the stubs should be stored.

## 7.4 github actions

### pytests.yml 

This workflow will :

- test the workstation scripts 

- test the createstubs.py script on multiple micropython linux versions 

- test the minified createstubs.py script on multiple micropython linux versions 

### run minify-pr.yml

This workflow will :

- create a minified version of createstubs.py 

- run a quick test on that 

- and submit a PR to the branch <branch>-minify



# 8 - Stubs 

Initially I also stored all the generated subs in the same repo. That turned out to be a bit of a hassle and since then I have moved [all the stubs][all-stubs] to the [micropython-stubs][] repo

Below are the most relevant stub sources referenced in this project.

## 8.1 Firmware and libraries 

### 8.1.1 MicroPython firmware and frozen modules _[MIT]_

| dastultz/micropython-pyb   | a pyb.py file for use with IDEs in developing a project for the Pyboard | Apache 2|

### Stub source: MicroPython-lib > CPython backports _[MIT, Python]_

While micropython-lib focuses on MicroPython, sometimes it may be beneficial to run MicroPython code using CPython, e.g. to use code coverage, debugging, etc. tools available for it. To facilitate such usage, micropython-lib also provides re-implementations ("backports") of MicroPython modules which run on CPython. 
https://github.com/pfalcon/micropython-lib#cpython-backports

### micropython_pyb _[Apache 2]_

This project provides a pyb.py file for use with IDEs in developing a project for the Pyboard.

# 9 - References 

## 9.1 - Inspiration 

### Thonny - MicroPython _cmd_dump_api_info  _[MIT License]_

The `createstubs.py` script to create the stubs is based on the work of Aivar Annamaa and the Thonny crew.
It is somewhere deep in the code and is apparently only used during the development cycle but it showed a way how to extract/generate a representation of the MicroPython modules written in C

While the concepts remain,  the code has been rewritten to run on a micropython board, rather than on a connected PC running CPython.
Please refer to :  
https://github.com/thonny/thonny/blob/786f63ff4460abe84f28c14dad2f9e78fe42cc49/thonny/plugins/micropython/__init__.py#L608


### MyPy Stubgen

[MyPy stubgen](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/docs/source/stubgen.rst#automatic-stub-generation-stubgen) is used to generate stubs for the frozen modules and for the `*.py` stubs that were generated on a board.  

### make_stub_files _[Public Domain]_

https://github.com/edreamleo/make-stub-files

This script `make_stub_files.py` makes a stub (.pyi) file in the output directory for each source file listed on the command line (wildcard file names are supported). 

The script does no type inference. Instead, the user supplies patterns in a configuration file. The script matches these patterns to:
The names of arguments in functions and methods and
The text of return expressions. Return expressions are the actual text of whatever follows the "return" keyword. The script removes all comments in return expressions and converts all strings to "str". This preprocessing greatly simplifies pattern matching.

Note: it was found that the stubs / prototypes of some functions with complex arguments were not handled correctly,
resulting in incorrectly formatted stubs (.pyi) 
Therefore this functionality has been replaced by  MyPy `stubgen`
