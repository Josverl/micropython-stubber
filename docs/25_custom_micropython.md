# Generating Stubs for Custom MicroPython Builds

This guide explains how to generate stubs for custom MicroPython builds, including:
- Custom branches or forks
- Pull requests (PRs) 
- Specific commits
- Local modifications

**New in v1.26.0+**: The `stubber clone` and `stubber switch` commands have been enhanced to work with custom repositories and arbitrary git references (branches, commits, tags).

## Overview

When working with custom MicroPython firmware, the standard workflow needs to be adapted to work with your specific repository and commit. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for different scenarios.

## Prerequisites

1. Install micropython-stubber:
   ```bash
   pip install micropython-stubber
   ```

2. Create a working directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-custom-stubs
   cd my-custom-stubs
   ```

## Enhanced CLI Commands

The following CLI commands have been enhanced to support custom builds:

### `stubber clone` - Enhanced for Custom Repositories

```bash
# Clone your fork of MicroPython
stubber clone --mpy-repo https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/micropython.git

# Clone both custom MicroPython and custom lib
stubber clone \
  --mpy-repo https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/micropython.git \
  --mpy-lib-repo https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/micropython-lib.git \
  --add-stubs
```

### `stubber switch` - Enhanced for Any Git Reference

```bash
# Switch to any branch
stubber switch feature-branch

# Switch to any commit hash
stubber switch abc123def456

# Switch to traditional tags (still works)
stubber switch v1.22.0

# Switch to special versions
stubber switch preview
stubber switch stable
```

## Scenario-Based Workflows

## Scenario 1: Working with a Fork

If you have a fork of MicroPython with custom changes:

### Step 1: Clone Your Custom Repository

You can now use the enhanced `stubber clone` command with custom repositories:

```bash
# Clone your fork directly using the enhanced clone command
stubber clone --mpy-repo https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/micropython.git --add-stubs

# Or manually clone if you prefer more control:
mkdir repos
cd repos

# Clone your fork instead of the official repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/micropython.git
git clone https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib.git

# Optional: clone stubs repo for reference
git clone https://github.com/josverl/micropython-stubs.git

cd ..
```

### Step 2: Switch to Your Branch/Commit

The `stubber switch` command now accepts arbitrary branches and commits:

```bash
# Switch to your custom branch
stubber switch your-custom-branch

# Or switch to a specific commit
stubber switch abc123def456

# Or switch to a PR branch (if you fetched it)
stubber switch pr-12345
```

### Step 3: Generate Stubs

Now you can use the stubber commands with your custom setup:

```bash
# Generate documentation stubs from your custom MicroPython
stubber get-docstubs --version=custom

# Generate frozen module stubs
stubber get-frozen --version=custom

# If you have a connected board with your custom firmware:
stubber get-mcu --version=custom
```

## Scenario 2: Working with a Pull Request

To generate stubs for a specific Pull Request:

### Step 1: Clone and Checkout PR

```bash
# Clone official repo
stubber clone --add-stubs
cd repos/micropython

# Fetch the PR (replace 12345 with PR number)
git fetch origin pull/12345/head:pr-12345

cd ../..

# Now switch to the PR branch using stubber
stubber switch pr-12345
```

### Step 2: Generate Stubs

```bash
stubber get-docstubs --version=pr-12345
stubber get-frozen --version=pr-12345
```

## Scenario 3: Working with Local Modifications

If you have local modifications to MicroPython:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Modified Repository

```bash
# Clone the official repo first
stubber clone --add-stubs
cd repos/micropython

# Apply your modifications
# ... make your changes ...

# Optionally commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "My custom modifications"
git tag my-custom-build  # Create a tag for reference

cd ../..
```

### Step 2: Switch and Generate Stubs

```bash
# Switch to your custom tag/commit
stubber switch my-custom-build

# Or if you want to use the current working directory state
stubber get-docstubs --version=my-custom-build
stubber get-frozen --version=my-custom-build
```

## Scenario 4: Complete Workflow for Custom Firmware

This is a complete example for generating stubs for a custom RPi Pico W build:

### Step 1: Setup Custom Repository

```bash
mkdir rpi-pico-w-custom
cd rpi-pico-w-custom

# Clone your fork using the enhanced clone command
stubber clone --mpy-repo https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/micropython.git --add-stubs

# Switch to your custom branch
stubber switch your-pico-w-branch
```

### Step 2: Build Your Custom Firmware (Optional)

If you need to build the firmware:

```bash
cd repos/micropython

# Install build dependencies (varies by platform)
# For Pico W:
cd ports/rp2
make submodules
make BOARD=RPI_PICO_W

# Your custom firmware is now in build-RPI_PICO_W/firmware.uf2
cd ../../..
```

### Step 3: Flash Custom Firmware and Generate Device Stubs

Flash your custom firmware to the device, then:

```bash
# Generate stubs directly from the device
stubber get-mcu --version=custom-pico-w
```

This will:
1. Connect to your device
2. Run the stub generation script
3. Download the generated stubs
4. Save them with your custom version name

### Step 4: Generate Documentation and Frozen Stubs

```bash
# Generate stubs from documentation
stubber get-docstubs --version=custom-pico-w

# Generate frozen module stubs
stubber get-frozen --version=custom-pico-w
```

### Step 5: Merge and Build Final Stubs

```bash
# Merge all stub types together
stubber merge --version=custom-pico-w --port=rp2 --board=RPI_PICO_W

# Build final stub packages
stubber build --version=custom-pico-w --port=rp2 --board=RPI_PICO_W
```

## Working Without Version Tags

If you prefer to work with the current checkout without specifying versions:

```bash
# This uses whatever is currently checked out
stubber get-docstubs
stubber get-frozen
stubber get-mcu
```

The stubs will be generated with `latest` as the version identifier.

## Tips and Best Practices

### 1. Naming Your Custom Versions

Use meaningful version names that help you identify your build:
- `--version=my-feature-v1.22.0`
- `--version=pr-12345-dma-support`
- `--version=custom-pico-w-2024-01`

### 2. Directory Structure

Keep your custom builds organized:
```
my-project/
├── repos/
│   ├── micropython/          # Your custom MicroPython
│   ├── micropython-lib/      # Compatible micropython-lib
│   └── micropython-stubs/    # Reference stubs (optional)
├── stubs/                    # Generated stubs
└── firmware/                 # Your built firmware files
```

### 3. Reproducible Builds

Document your exact setup:
```bash
# Save commit hashes for reproducibility
cd repos/micropython
echo "MicroPython: $(git rev-parse HEAD)" > ../build-info.txt
cd ../micropython-lib  
echo "MicroPython-lib: $(git rev-parse HEAD)" >> ../build-info.txt
```

### 4. Version Compatibility

When working with older commits:
- Use compatible micropython-lib versions
- Some features may not be available in older versions
- Check the micropython-stubber compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Repositories Error

If you get an error about missing repositories:
```
Repo micropython not found, use 'stubber clone --add-stubs' to clone the repos.
```

Make sure your directory structure is correct:
```bash
# Check that repos exist
ls repos/micropython/.git
ls repos/micropython-lib/.git
```

### Version Not Found

If stubber can't find your version, make sure you're using consistent naming:
```bash
# Check what git thinks the current version is
cd repos/micropython
git describe --tags --always
```

### Build Failures

If stub generation fails:
1. Check that your MicroPython modification didn't break documentation parsing
2. Verify all required files are present in your custom build
3. Check the logs for specific error messages
