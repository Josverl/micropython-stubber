        Like :meth:`poll.poll`, but instead returns an iterator which yields a
        `callee-owned tuple`. This function provides an efficient, allocation-free
        way to poll on streams.

        If *flags* is 1, one-shot behaviour for events is employed: streams for
        which events happened will have their event masks automatically reset
        (equivalent to ``poll.modify(obj, 0)``), so new events for such a stream
        won't be processed until new mask is set with `poll.modify()`. This
        behaviour is useful for asynchronous I/O schedulers.
