MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.24.0/library/esp.html

The ``esp`` module contains specific functions related to both the ESP8266 and
ESP32 modules.  Some functions are only available on one or the other of these
ports.

    :no-index:

    ``Note:`` This is the ESP32 form of this function.

    Change the level of OS serial debug log messages. On boot, OS
    serial debug log messages are limited to Error output only.

    The behaviour of this function depends on the arguments passed to it. The
    following combinations are supported:

    ``osdebug(None)`` restores the default OS debug log message level
    (``LOG_ERROR``).

    ``osdebug(0)`` enables all available OS debug log messages (in the
    default build configuration this is ``LOG_INFO``).

    ``osdebug(0, level)`` sets the OS debug log message level to the
     specified value. The log levels are defined as constants:

        * ``LOG_NONE`` -- No log output
        * ``LOG_ERROR`` -- Critical errors, software module can not recover on its own
        * ``LOG_WARN`` -- Error conditions from which recovery measures have been taken
        * ``LOG_INFO`` -- Information messages which describe normal flow of events
        * ``LOG_DEBUG`` -- Extra information which is not necessary for normal use (values, pointers, sizes, etc)
        * ``LOG_VERBOSE`` -- Bigger chunks of debugging information, or frequent messages
          which can potentially flood the output

    ``Note:`` ``LOG_DEBUG`` and ``LOG_VERBOSE`` are not compiled into the
              MicroPython binary by default, to save size. A custom build with a
              modified "``sdkconfig``" source file is needed to see any output
              at these log levels.

    ``Note:`` Log output on ESP32 is automatically suspended in "Raw REPL" mode,
              to prevent communications issues. This means OS level logging is never
              seen when using ``mpremote run`` and similar tools.

def set_native_code_location(start: None, length: None, /) -> None:
    """
    **Note**: ESP8266 only

    Set the location that native code will be placed for execution after it is
    compiled.  Native code is emitted when the ``@micropython.native``,
    ``@micropython.viper`` and ``@micropython.asm_xtensa`` decorators are applied
    to a function.  The ESP8266 must execute code from either iRAM or the lower
    1MByte of flash (which is memory mapped), and this function controls the
    location.

    If *start* and *length* are both ``None`` then the native code location is
    set to the unused portion of memory at the end of the iRAM1 region.  The
    size of this unused portion depends on the firmware and is typically quite
    small (around 500 bytes), and is enough to store a few very small
    functions.  The advantage of using this iRAM1 region is that it does not
    get worn out by writing to it.

    If neither *start* nor *length* are ``None`` then they should be integers.
    *start* should specify the byte offset from the beginning of the flash at
    which native code should be stored.  *length* specifies how many bytes of
    flash from *start* can be used to store native code.  *start* and *length*
    should be multiples of the sector size (being 4096 bytes).  The flash will
    be automatically erased before writing to it so be sure to use a region of
    flash that is not otherwise used, for example by the firmware or the
    filesystem.

    When using the flash to store native code *start+length* must be less
    than or equal to 1MByte.  Note that the flash can be worn out if repeated
    erasures (and writes) are made so use this feature sparingly.
    In particular, native code needs to be recompiled and rewritten to flash
    on each boot (including wake from deepsleep).

    In both cases above, using iRAM1 or flash, if there is no more room left
    in the specified region then the use of a native decorator on a function
    will lead to `MemoryError` exception being raised during compilation of
    that function.
