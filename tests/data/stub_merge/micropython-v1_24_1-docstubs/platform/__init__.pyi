    Returns a string identifying the underlying platform. This string is composed

    - the name of the platform system (e.g. Unix, Windows or MicroPython)
    - the MicroPython version
    - the architecture of the platform
    - the version of the underlying platform
    - the concatenation of the name of the libc that MicroPython is linked to
