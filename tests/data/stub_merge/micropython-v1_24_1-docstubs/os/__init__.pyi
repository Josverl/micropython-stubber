     - Some platforms may return a 4-tuple that includes the entry's *size*.  For
       file entries, *size* is an integer representing the size of the file
       or -1 if unknown.  Its meaning is currently undefined for directory

    Duplicate or switch the MicroPython terminal (the REPL) on the given `stream`-like

    from ``io.IOBase`` and implement the ``readinto()`` and
    ``write()`` methods.  The stream should be in non-blocking mode and
    ``readinto()`` should return ``None`` if there is no data available for reading.

    After calling this function all terminal output is repeated on this stream,
    and any input that is available on the stream is passed on to the terminal input.

    The *index* parameter should be a non-negative integer and specifies which
    duplication slot is set.  A given port may implement more than one slot (slot 0
    will always be available) and in that case terminal input and output is
    duplicated on all the slots that are set.

    If ``None`` is passed as the *stream_object* then duplication is cancelled on
    the slot given by *index*.

    The function returns the previous stream-like object in the given slot.
