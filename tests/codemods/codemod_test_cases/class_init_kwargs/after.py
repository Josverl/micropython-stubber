        Initialise the SPI bus with the given parameters:

          - ``baudrate`` is the SCK clock rate.
          - ``polarity`` can be 0 or 1, and is the level the idle clock line sits at.
          - ``phase`` can be 0 or 1 to sample data on the first or second clock edge
            respectively.
          - ``bits`` is the width in bits of each transfer. Only 8 is guaranteed to be supported by all hardware.
          - ``firstbit`` can be ``SPI.MSB`` or ``SPI.LSB``.
          - ``sck``, ``mosi``, ``miso`` are pins (machine.Pin) objects to use for bus signals. For most
            hardware SPI blocks (as selected by ``id`` parameter to the constructor), pins are fixed
            and cannot be changed. In some cases, hardware blocks allow 2-3 alternative pin sets for
            a hardware SPI block. Arbitrary pin assignments are possible only for a bitbanging SPI driver
            (``id`` = -1).
          - ``pins`` - WiPy port doesn't ``sck``, ``mosi``, ``miso`` arguments, and instead allows to
            specify them as a tuple of ``pins`` parameter.

        In the case of hardware SPI the actual clock frequency may be lower than the
        requested baudrate. This is dependant on the platform hardware. The actual
        rate may be determined by printing the SPI object.
