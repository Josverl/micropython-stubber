"""
In order to generate stups for all ports and boars and versions of micropython we need to know
what versions are available. This module provides functions to :
    - get a list of all ports for a given version of micropython  ( list micropython ports)
    - get a list of all ports and board for a given version of micropython (list micropython ports boards)

        - get a list of versions for micropython ( version candidates)
    - get the frozen stubs for a given version of micropython ( frozen candidates)
    - get a list of all the docstubs (docstub candidates)
    - get a list of the firmware/MCU stubs (firmware candidates)
