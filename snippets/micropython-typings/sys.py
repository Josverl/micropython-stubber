from typing import Any, Dict, List, Tuple

#    A mutable list of arguments the current program was started with.
argv: List
#    The byte order of the system (``"little"`` or ``"big"``).
byteorder: Any
#    Object with information about the current Python implementation. For
#    MicroPython, it has following attributes:
#
#    * *name* - string "micropython"
#    * *version* - tuple (major, minor, micro), e.g. (1, 7, 0)
#
#    This object is the recommended way to distinguish MicroPython from other
#    Python implementations (note that it still may not exist in the very
#    minimal ports).
implementation: Any
#    Maximum value which a native integer type can hold on the current platform,
#    or maximum value representable by MicroPython integer type, if it's smaller
#    than platform max value (that is the case for MicroPython ports without
#    long int support).
#
#    This attribute is useful for detecting "bitness" of a platform (32-bit vs
#    64-bit, etc.). It's recommended to not compare this attribute to some
#    value directly, but instead count number of bits in it::
#
#     bits = 0
#     v = sys.maxsize
#     while v:
#         bits += 1
#         v >>= 1
#     if bits > 32:
#         # 64-bit (or more) platform
maxsize: int 
#    Dictionary of loaded modules. On some ports, it may not include builtin
#    modules.
modules: Dict
#    A mutable list of directories to search for imported modules.
path: List
#    The platform that MicroPython is running on. For OS/RTOS ports, this is
#    usually an identifier of the OS, e.g. ``"linux"``. For baremetal ports it
#    is an identifier of a board, e.g. ``"pyboard"`` for the original MicroPython
#    reference board. It thus can be used to distinguish one board from another.
#    If you need to check whether your program runs on MicroPython (vs other
#    Python implementation), use `sys.implementation` instead.
platform: Any = ...
#    Standard error `stream`.
stderr: Any = ...
#    Standard input `stream`.
stdin: Any = ...
#    Standard output `stream`.
stdout: Any = ...
#    Python language version that this implementation conforms to, as a string.
version: str
#    Python language version that this implementation conforms to, as a tuple of ints.
