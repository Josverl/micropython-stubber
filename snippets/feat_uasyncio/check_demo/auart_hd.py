# Demo of running a half-duplex protocol to a device. The device never sends
# unsolicited messages. An example is a communications device which responds
# to AT commands.
# The master sends a message to the device, which may respond with one or more
# lines of data. The master assumes that the device has sent all its data when
# a timeout has elapsed.

# In this test a physical device is emulated by the Device class
# To test link X1-X4 and X2-X3

# The master's send_command() method sends a command and waits for a number of
# lines from the device. The end of the process is signified by a timeout, when
# a list of lines is returned. This allows line-by-line processing.
# A special test mode demonstrates the behaviour with a non-responding device. If
# None is passed, no commend is sent. The master waits for a response which never
# arrives and returns an empty list.
