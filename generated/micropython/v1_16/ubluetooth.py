   :synopsis: Low-level Bluetooth radio functionality

This module provides an interface to a Bluetooth controller on a board.
Currently this supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) in Central, Peripheral,
Broadcaster, and Observer roles, as well as GATT Server and Client and L2CAP
connection-oriented-channels. A device may operate in multiple roles
concurrently. Pairing (and bonding) is supported on some ports.

This API is intended to match the low-level Bluetooth protocol and provide
building-blocks for higher-level abstractions such as specific device types.

        Get or set configuration values of the BLE interface.  To get a value the
        parameter name should be quoted as a string, and just one parameter is
        queried at a time.  To set values use the keyword syntax, and one ore more
        parameter can be set at a time.

        Currently supported values are:

        - ``'mac'``: The current address in use, depending on the current address mode.
          This returns a tuple of ``(addr_type, addr)``.

          See :meth:`gatts_write <BLE.gap_scan>` for details about address type.

          This may only be queried while the interface is currently active.

        - ``'addr_mode'``: Sets the address mode. Values can be:

            * 0x00 - PUBLIC - Use the controller's public address.
            * 0x01 - RANDOM - Use a generated static address.
            * 0x02 - RPA - Use resolvable private addresses.
            * 0x03 - NRPA - Use non-resolvable private addresses.

          By default the interface mode will use a PUBLIC address if available, otherwise
          it will use a RANDOM address.

        - ``'gap_name'``: Get/set the GAP device name used by service 0x1800,
          characteristic 0x2a00.  This can be set at any time and changed multiple
          times.

        - ``'rxbuf'``: Get/set the size in bytes of the internal buffer used to store
          incoming events.  This buffer is global to the entire BLE driver and so
          handles incoming data for all events, including all characteristics.
          Increasing this allows better handling of bursty incoming data (for
          example scan results) and the ability to receive larger characteristic values.

        - ``'mtu'``: Get/set the MTU that will be used during a ATT MTU exchange. The
          resulting MTU will be the minimum of this and the remote device's MTU.
          ATT MTU exchange will not happen automatically (unless the remote device initiates
          it), and must be manually initiated with
          :meth:`gattc_exchange_mtu<BLE.gattc_exchange_mtu>`.
          Use the ``_IRQ_MTU_EXCHANGED`` event to discover the MTU for a given connection.

        - ``'bond'``: Sets whether bonding will be enabled during pairing. When
          enabled, pairing requests will set the "bond" flag and the keys will be stored
          by both devices.

        - ``'mitm'``: Sets whether MITM-protection is required for pairing.

        - ``'io'``: Sets the I/O capabilities of this device.

          Available options are::

            _IO_CAPABILITY_DISPLAY_ONLY = const(0)
            _IO_CAPABILITY_DISPLAY_YESNO = const(1)
            _IO_CAPABILITY_KEYBOARD_ONLY = const(2)
            _IO_CAPABILITY_NO_INPUT_OUTPUT = const(3)
            _IO_CAPABILITY_KEYBOARD_DISPLAY = const(4)

        - ``'le_secure'``: Sets whether "LE Secure" pairing is required. Default is
          false (i.e. allow "Legacy Pairing").
        """

    # .. method:: BLE.irq(handler, /)
    def irq(self, handler, /) -> Any:
        """
            Registers a callback for events from the BLE stack. The *handler* takes two
            arguments, ``event`` (which will be one of the codes below) and ``data``
            (which is an event-specific tuple of values).

            **Note:** As an optimisation to prevent unnecessary allocations, the ``addr``,
            ``adv_data``, ``char_data``, ``notify_data``, and ``uuid`` entries in the
            tuples are read-only memoryview instances pointing to ubluetooth's internal
            ringbuffer, and are only valid during the invocation of the IRQ handler
            function.  If your program needs to save one of these values to access after
            the IRQ handler has returned (e.g. by saving it in a class instance or global
            variable), then it needs to take a copy of the data, either by using ``bytes()``
            or ``bluetooth.UUID()``, like this::

                connected_addr = bytes(addr)  # equivalently: adv_data, char_data, or notify_data
                matched_uuid = bluetooth.UUID(uuid)

            For example, the IRQ handler for a scan result might inspect the ``adv_data``
            to decide if it's the correct device, and only then copy the address data to be
            used elsewhere in the program.  And to print data from within the IRQ handler,
            ``print(bytes(addr))`` will be needed.

        The scanner will run for *window_us* **micro**\ seconds every *interval_us*
        **micro**\ seconds for a total of *duration_ms* **milli**\ seconds. The default
        interval and window are 1.28 seconds and 11.25 milliseconds respectively
        (background scanning).

        For each scan result the ``_IRQ_SCAN_RESULT`` event will be raised, with event
        data ``(addr_type, addr, adv_type, rssi, adv_data)``.

        ``addr_type`` values indicate public or random addresses:
            * 0x00 - PUBLIC
            * 0x01 - RANDOM (either static, RPA, or NRPA, the type is encoded in the address itself)

        ``adv_type`` values correspond to the Bluetooth Specification:

            * 0x00 - ADV_IND - connectable and scannable undirected advertising
            * 0x01 - ADV_DIRECT_IND - connectable directed advertising
            * 0x02 - ADV_SCAN_IND - scannable undirected advertising
            * 0x03 - ADV_NONCONN_IND - non-connectable undirected advertising
            * 0x04 - SCAN_RSP - scan response

        ``active`` can be set ``True`` if you want to receive scan responses in the results.

        When scanning is stopped (either due to the duration finishing or when
        explicitly stopped), the ``_IRQ_SCAN_DONE`` event will be raised.

        existing services.

        *services_definition* is a list of **services**, where each **service** is a
        two-element tuple containing a UUID and a list of **characteristics**.

        Each **characteristic** is a two-or-three-element tuple containing a UUID, a
        **flags** value, and optionally a list of *descriptors*.

        Each **descriptor** is a two-element tuple containing a UUID and a **flags**
        value.

        The **flags** are a bitwise-OR combination of the flags defined below. These
        set both the behaviour of the characteristic (or descriptor) as well as the
        security and privacy requirements.

        The return value is a list (one element per service) of tuples (each element
        is a value handle). Characteristics and descriptor handles are flattened
        into the same tuple, in the order that they are defined.

        **Note:** Advertising must be stopped before registering services.
