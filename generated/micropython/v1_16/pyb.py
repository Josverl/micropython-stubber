# .. function:: freq([sysclk[, hclk[, pclk1[, pclk2]]]])
def freq(sysclk, hclk, pclk1, pclk2) -> Any:
    """
    If given no arguments, returns a tuple of clock frequencies:
    (sysclk, hclk, pclk1, pclk2).
    These correspond to:

     - sysclk: frequency of the CPU
     - hclk: frequency of the AHB bus, core memory and DMA
     - pclk1: frequency of the APB1 bus
     - pclk2: frequency of the APB2 bus

    If given any arguments then the function sets the frequency of the CPU,
    and the buses if additional arguments are given.  Frequencies are given in
    Hz.  Eg freq(120000000) sets sysclk (the CPU frequency) to 120MHz.  Note that
    not all values are supported and the largest supported frequency not greater
    than the given value will be selected.

    Supported sysclk frequencies are (in MHz): 8, 16, 24, 30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 48,
    54, 56, 60, 64, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 144, 168.

    The maximum frequency of hclk is 168MHz, of pclk1 is 42MHz, and of pclk2 is
    84MHz.  Be sure not to set frequencies above these values.

    The hclk, pclk1 and pclk2 frequencies are derived from the sysclk frequency
    using a prescaler (divider).  Supported prescalers for hclk are: 1, 2, 4, 8,
    16, 64, 128, 256, 512.  Supported prescalers for pclk1 and pclk2 are: 1, 2,
    4, 8.  A prescaler will be chosen to best match the requested frequency.

    A sysclk frequency of
    8MHz uses the HSE (external crystal) directly and 16MHz uses the HSI
    (internal oscillator) directly.  The higher frequencies use the HSE to
    drive the PLL (phase locked loop), and then use the output of the PLL.

    Note that if you change the frequency while the USB is enabled then
    the USB may become unreliable.  It is best to change the frequency
    in boot.py, before the USB peripheral is started.  Also note that sysclk
    frequencies below 36MHz do not allow the USB to function correctly.

    If called with no arguments, return the current USB mode as a string.

    - ``'MSC'``: enable with MSC (mass storage device class) interface
    - ``'VCP+MSC'``: enable with VCP and MSC
    - ``'VCP+HID'``: enable with VCP and HID (human interface device)
    - ``'VCP+MSC+HID'``: enabled with VCP, MSC and HID (only available on PYBD boards)

    For backwards compatibility, ``'CDC'`` is understood to mean
    ``'VCP'`` (and similarly for ``'CDC+MSC'`` and ``'CDC+HID'``).

    The *port* parameter should be an integer (0, 1, ...) and selects which
    USB port to use if the board supports multiple ports.  A value of -1 uses
    the default or automatically selected port.

    The *vid* and *pid* parameters allow you to specify the VID (vendor id)
    and PID (product id).  A *pid* value of -1 will select a PID based on the
    value of *modestr*.

    If enabling MSC mode, the *msc* parameter can be used to specify a list
    of SCSI LUNs to expose on the mass storage interface.  For example
    ``msc=(pyb.Flash(), pyb.SDCard())``.

    If enabling HID mode, you may also specify the HID details by
    passing the *hid* keyword parameter.  It takes a tuple of
    (subclass, protocol, max packet length, polling interval, report
    descriptor).  By default it will set appropriate values for a USB
    mouse.  There is also a ``pyb.hid_keyboard`` constant, which is an
    appropriate tuple for a USB keyboard.

    The *high_speed* parameter, when set to ``True``, enables USB HS mode if
    it is supported by the hardware.

        Read analog values into ``buf`` at a rate set by the ``timer`` object.

        ``buf`` can be bytearray or array.array for example.  The ADC values have
        12-bit resolution and are stored directly into ``buf`` if its element size is
        16 bits or greater.  If ``buf`` has only 8-bit elements (eg a bytearray) then
        the sample resolution will be reduced to 8 bits.

        ``timer`` should be a Timer object, and a sample is read each time the timer
        triggers.  The timer must already be initialised and running at the desired
        sampling frequency.

        To support previous behaviour of this function, ``timer`` can also be an
        integer which specifies the frequency (in Hz) to sample at.  In this case
        Timer(6) will be automatically configured to run at the given frequency.

        Example using a Timer object (preferred way)::

    def read_timed_multi(self, adcs, bufs, timer) -> Any:
        """
        This is a static method. It can be used to extract relative timing or
        phase data from multiple ADC's.

        It reads analog values from multiple ADC's into buffers at a rate set by
        the *timer* object. Each time the timer triggers a sample is rapidly
        read from each ADC in turn.

        ADC and buffer instances are passed in tuples with each ADC having an
        associated buffer. All buffers must be of the same type and length and
        the number of buffers must equal the number of ADC's.

        Buffers can be ``bytearray`` or ``array.array`` for example. The ADC values
        have 12-bit resolution and are stored directly into the buffer if its element
        size is 16 bits or greater.  If buffers have only 8-bit elements (eg a
        ``bytearray``) then the sample resolution will be reduced to 8 bits.

        *timer* must be a Timer object. The timer must already be initialised
        and running at the desired sampling frequency.

        Example reading 3 ADC's::

            adc0 = pyb.ADC(pyb.Pin.board.X1)    # Create ADC's
            adc1 = pyb.ADC(pyb.Pin.board.X2)

            rx2 = array.array('H', (0 for i in range(100)))
            # read analog values into buffers at 100Hz (takes one second)
            pyb.ADC.read_timed_multi((adc0, adc1, adc2), (rx0, rx1, rx2), tim)
            for n in range(len(rx0)):
                print(rx0[n], rx1[n], rx2[n])

        This function does not allocate any heap memory. It has blocking behaviour:
        it does not return to the calling program until the buffers are full.

        The function returns ``True`` if all samples were acquired with correct
        timing. At high sample rates the time taken to acquire a set of samples
        can exceed the timer period. In this case the function returns ``False``,
        indicating a loss of precision in the sample interval. In extreme cases
        samples may be missed.

        The maximum rate depends on factors including the data width and the
        number of ADC's being read. In testing two ADC's were sampled at a timer
        rate of 210kHz without overrun. Samples were missed at 215kHz.  For three
        ADC's the limit is around 140kHz, and for four it is around 110kHz.
        At high sample rates disabling interrupts for the duration can reduce the
        risk of sporadic data loss.

            of the last bit sample with respect to the whole bit time. The default *sample_point* is 75%.

        The time quanta tq is the basic unit of time for the CAN bus.  tq is the CAN
        prescaler value divided by PCLK1 (the frequency of internal peripheral bus 1);
        see :meth:`pyb.freq()` to determine PCLK1.

        A single bit is made up of the synchronisation segment, which is always 1 tq.
        Then follows bit segment 1, then bit segment 2.  The sample point is after bit
        segment 1 finishes.  The transmit point is after bit segment 2 finishes.
        The baud rate will be 1/bittime, where the bittime is 1 + BS1 + BS2 multiplied
        by the time quanta tq.

        For example, with PCLK1=42MHz, prescaler=100, sjw=1, bs1=6, bs2=8, the value of
        tq is 2.38 microseconds.  The bittime is 35.7 microseconds, and the baudrate
        is 28kHz.

            view this as the frequency with which the timer goes through one complete cycle.

          - ``prescaler`` [0-0xffff] - specifies the value to be loaded into the
            timer's Prescaler Register (PSC). The timer clock source is divided by
            (``prescaler + 1``) to arrive at the timer clock. Timers 2-7 and 12-14
            have a clock source of 84 MHz (pyb.freq()[2] \* 2), and Timers 1, and 8-11
            have a clock source of 168 MHz (pyb.freq()[3] \* 2).

          - ``period`` [0-0xffff] for timers 1, 3, 4, and 6-15. [0-0x3fffffff] for timers 2 & 5.
            Specifies the value to be loaded into the timer's AutoReload
            Register (ARR). This determines the period of the timer (i.e. when the
            counter cycles). The timer counter will roll-over after ``period + 1``
            timer clock cycles.

          - ``mode`` can be one of:

            - ``Timer.UP`` - configures the timer to count from 0 to ARR (default)
            - ``Timer.DOWN`` - configures the timer to count from ARR down to 0.
            - ``Timer.CENTER`` - configures the timer to count from 0 to ARR and
              then back down to 0.

          - ``div`` can be one of 1, 2, or 4. Divides the timer clock to determine
            the sampling clock used by the digital filters.

          - ``callback`` - as per Timer.callback()

          - ``deadtime`` - specifies the amount of "dead" or inactive time between
            transitions on complimentary channels (both channels will be inactive)
            for this time). ``deadtime`` may be an integer between 0 and 1008, with

            2, 256-512 in steps of 8, and 512-1008 in steps of 16. ``deadtime``

            - ``Timer.OC_FORCED_ACTIVE`` --- the pin is forced active (compare match is ignored).
            - ``Timer.OC_FORCED_INACTIVE`` --- the pin is forced inactive (compare match is ignored).
            - ``Timer.IC`` --- configure the timer in Input Capture mode.
            - ``Timer.ENC_A`` --- configure the timer in Encoder mode. The counter only changes when CH1 changes.
            - ``Timer.ENC_B`` --- configure the timer in Encoder mode. The counter only changes when CH2 changes.
            - ``Timer.ENC_AB`` --- configure the timer in Encoder mode. The counter changes when CH1 or CH2 changes.

          - ``callback`` - as per TimerChannel.callback()

          - ``pin`` None (the default) or a Pin object. If specified (and not None)
            this will cause the alternate function of the the indicated pin
            to be configured for this timer channel. An error will be raised if
            the pin doesn't support any alternate functions for this timer channel.

        Keyword arguments for Timer.PWM modes:

          - ``pulse_width`` - determines the initial pulse width value to use.
          - ``pulse_width_percent`` - determines the initial pulse width percentage to use.

        Keyword arguments for Timer.OC modes:

          - ``compare`` - determines the initial value of the compare register.

          - ``polarity`` can be one of:

            - ``Timer.HIGH`` - output is active high
            - ``Timer.LOW`` - output is active low

        Optional keyword arguments for Timer.IC modes:

          - ``polarity`` can be one of:

            - ``Timer.RISING`` - captures on rising edge.
            - ``Timer.FALLING`` - captures on falling edge.
            - ``Timer.BOTH`` - captures on both edges.

          Note that capture only works on the primary channel, and not on the
          complimentary channels.

        Notes for Timer.ENC modes:

          - Requires 2 pins, so one or both pins will need to be configured to use
            the appropriate timer AF using the Pin API.
          - Read the encoder value using the timer.counter() method.
          - Only works on CH1 and CH2 (and not on CH1N or CH2N)
          - The channel number is ignored when setting the encoder mode.

        UART(1) and UART(6) and 650 for the others.  Use :func:`pyb.freq <pyb.freq>`
        to reduce the bus frequencies to get lower baudrates.

        *Note:* with parity=None, only 8 and 9 bits are supported.  With parity enabled,
