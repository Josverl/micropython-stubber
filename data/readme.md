# Overview of modules avaialble on different ports and boards
These files are used to compile a list of modules that createstubs.py and its variants will attempt to create stubs for.

This can be generated by running the following command in micropython on the board: `help('modules')`  
or via mpremote by running the following command: `mpremote exec "help('modules')"`

Store the ouput in a file called `micropython-<version>-<port>[-<board>].txt` in this directory.
place a comment `#` before all lines that do not not contain module names.

After adding or changing any file update the list of modules using from the root of the repository.
```
stubber update-module-list
stubber make-variants
```
