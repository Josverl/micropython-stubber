    Time a pulse on the given *pin*, and return the duration of the pulse in
    microseconds.  The *pulse_level* argument should be 0 to time a low pulse
    or 1 to time a high pulse.

    If the current input value of the pin is different to *pulse_level*,
    the function first (*) waits until the pin input becomes equal to *pulse_level*,
    then (**) times the duration that the pin is equal to *pulse_level*.
    If the pin is already equal to *pulse_level* then timing starts straight away.

    The function will return -2 if there was timeout waiting for condition marked
    (*) above, and -1 if there was timeout during the main measurement, marked (**)
    above. The timeout is the same for both cases and given by *timeout_us* (which
    is in microseconds).
