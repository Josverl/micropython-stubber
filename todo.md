# stubber : 

-  improve generation of class methods to include (self,...) 
        Normal methods should have at least one parameter (the first of which should be 'self').

- document - that gc and sys modules are somhowe ignored by pylint and will keep throwing errors 

- add mpy information to manifest 
- use 'nightly' naming convetion in createsubs.py

# frozen stubs 
- Done - generate manifest.json 
- add simple readme.md ?

# cpython

- read RST files 

- add prototypes from RST 
        ref: https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/stubdoc.py

- add prototypes from Source ? 
        check if https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/stubgenc.py
        might bge usefull

- test to automerge common prototypes by stubber
        ie. add common return types to make_stub_files.cfg

- resolve import time issues 

# Structuur op machine 

# SYS en GC 
#pylint: disable=no-member      ## workaround for sys and gc

Module 'gc' has no 'mem_free' member
Module 'gc' has no 'threshold' member
Module 'gc' has no 'mem_free' member
Module 'gc' has no 'mem_alloc' member

# strange messages in Python Language Server output

these seem to be the language predictions when autocompletion is used in the code editor 


import os
os.<tab>

--> this shows a dropdown with *
and thesre are listed in the output window


import uos
uos.<tab>
-->  no start , no returns in the output window
